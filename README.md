# Early-Warning-Prediction-of-Environmental-Parameters

Our objective is to perform time series forecasting and analysis on environmental
parameters including CO2 , CO, NO, temperature, and humidity data collected
from underground mines. We aim to predict future values of these parameters
using time series algorithms such as SARIMA, LSTM and XGBOOST.
Additionally, we will compare the forecasting results of SARIMA,
XGBOOST and LSTM models. Furthermore, we will analyze the environmental
conditions over time and identify daily time periods when the environmental
condition is categorized as Good, Satisfactory, Poor, Very poor, or Severe.
Finally, we will determine which parameters need to be controlled or mitigated
to maintain optimal environmental conditions within the underground mines.
